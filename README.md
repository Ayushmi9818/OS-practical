# OS-practical
There are some practical exzmple regarding cpu schedueling & processes.
# Q1 ROUND ROBIN schedueling
Round Robin is a CPU scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slot in a cyclic way. It is simple, easy to implement, and starvation-free as all processes get fair share of CPU. once a process is executed for a given time period ,it is preempted and other process executesfor a given time period.

In this program, I have simulated the round robin algorithm with sample inputs.with quantum value =3

# Q2 Demonstration of Fork()
In this program, we are demonstrating the fork() function which is used for creating parent processes.
